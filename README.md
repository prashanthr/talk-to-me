# Talk to Me

Hello internet-loving-friend! 🙌🏽

Thanks for checking this project out. It's currently live at 
[https://talktome.space](https://talktome.space)

## Why was this built?

I've been using video chat applications for personal and professional use for many years. Skype, Google Hangouts, Cisco Webex etc. You name it. I've found none of them to operate  without any loss in connectivity or any issues. Hence I embarked on a journey to build my own version of a simple video/audio chat application that is lightweight and performs well at full capacity without any loss in packets. 

Hope you enjoy using it!
